/**
 * Play on Lichess as a bot.
 * <p>Allows engine play.<br/>
 * Only works with Bot accounts.
 * <p><b>Features</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Stream incoming chess moves
 * <li>Play chess moves
 * <li>Read and write in the player and spectator chats
 * <li>Receive, create and accept (or decline) challenges
 * <li>Abort and resign games
 * <li>Engine assistance is allowed
 * </ul>
 * <p><b>Restrictions</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Bots can only play challenge games: pools and tournaments are off-limits
 * <li>Bots cannot play UltraBullet (¼+0) because it requires making too many requests. But 0+1 and ½+0 are allowed.
 * </ul>
 * Example:
 * {@snippet :
 *      ClientAuth client = Client.auth("my-bot-token");
 *
 *      // Connect the bot to Lichess, becoming challengeable
 *      Stream<Event> events = client.bot().connect().stream();

 *      events.forEach( event -> {
